# House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is focused on building a Machine Learning model to predict house prices using the USA Housing dataset. The goal is to create a model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features, enabling homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals to make more informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "USA Housing" dataset, which includes information about various housing features and their corresponding prices. The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Avg. Area Income`: Average income of residents in the area.
- `Avg. Area House Age`: Average age of houses in the area.
- `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`: Average number of rooms in houses in the area.
- `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the area.
- `Area Population`: Population of the area.
- `Price`: Price of the house.

## Features

The main features used for house price prediction include:

- `Avg. Area Income`
- `Avg. Area House Age`
- `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`
- `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`
- `Area Population`

## Machine Learning Model

In this project, a Linear Regression model is employed to predict house prices based on the selected features. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on another portion to evaluate its performance. Key steps in the process include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Loading, exploring, and cleaning the dataset to prepare it for model training.
2. Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features for the prediction task.
3. Model Training: Training a Linear Regression model using the training data.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.
5. Price Predictions: Making predictions on the test dataset and visualizing the results.

## Usage

To run the project and build the house price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).
2. Download the "USA Housing" dataset or provide the path to the dataset in the code.
3. Execute the provided Python code, following the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook or script.
4. Examine the model's performance by reviewing evaluation metrics and prediction visualizations.
